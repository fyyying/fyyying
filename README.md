### Hi there 👋

I'm working on the #100DaysOfCode challenge👩‍💻 As a first product, I am working with my friend @simicd to creat a Web app with Rest API for risk-free yield curves.

- The curves are needed for regulatory reporting in Europe. 
- Data is publicly available but can only be accessed via single monthly Excel files and it is in a format that is difficult to use.
